Step 2: Variables, Operators, Input/Output

1.  Learn: variables, operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical), input/output (print statements).
2. Exercise: Write a script that prints test data (for example: username and password).

---

Step 3: Control Flow (if/else, switch, loops)

1.Learn: if/else statements, switch statements, loops (for, while).
2.Exercise: Write a script that validates login rules (for example: password must be at least 8 characters).

---

Step 4: Functions & Debugging

1.Learn: how to write reusable functions, debugging (using console logs, print statements, or breakpoints).
2. Task: Create a reusable login function that:

  a. Takes username and password as input
  b. Validates login rules
  c. Returns success or error messages

---

 Submission Guide

1. Create a single folder with your name. Example: LoginTask_FatimahHamzah
2. Inside the folder, include your files for each step.
3. Add a README file that contains: (optional)

   a. The programming language you chose
   b. Instructions on how to run your scripts
   c. Any notes or challenges you faced
4. Upload the folder to the shared Google Drive or GitHub.
5. Make sure the folder is accessible.

Submission Deadline: Saturday,  11/09/2025

Note:
For this Task uploading to GitHub or GitLab is optional but recommended if you can, because we will have a week task for using GitHub seperately

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. or any other dependencies depending on your choice

Verify that your tool opens successfully.


üöÄ Part 2: Run ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Automation

Objective: Verify your setup by running your first automation test.

Task:

Create a simple test that opens a browser and visits Google.

Run the test and confirm it passes successfully.


üîç Part 3: Learn and Practice Locators

Objective: Understand and use different types of web locators to find elements.

Concepts to learn:

CSS selectors

XPath

ID locators

Class locators

Task:

Open a sample web app (such as a practice login page).

Locate elements like username, password, and login button using different locator types.

Print confirmation or display feedback that each element was found successfully.


üì© SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

üïï Deadline:

Submission opens: Sunday, 6:00 PM (WAT)

Closes: Monday, 6:00 PM (WAT)

üì§ Submission Link:
